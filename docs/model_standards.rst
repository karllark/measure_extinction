Stellar Models as Standards
===========================

Background
----------

The usual method for measuring dust extinction is to use observations
of two stars with identical spectral types, one that is reddened and one
that is unreddened/lightly reddened.  The unreddened/lightly reddened star
is termed the standard meaning what a star of that spectral type looks like
without foreground dust.  The main pro in using observations for
the standard
is then the resulting extinction measurement only depends on the relative
calibration of the instrument used.  The main con is that getting a "perfect"
match of spectral types is rare and, hence, spectral mismatches impact the
accuracy of the resulting extinction measurements.

Alternatively, stellar atmosphere models can be used for the unreddened
standard stars.  This means that better spectral matching is possible, but
with the cost of now being dependent on the instrumental calibration of the
reddened star observation.  A good reference for using models as standards
is
`Fitzpatrick & Massa (2005) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AJ....130.1127F/abstract>`_.

In summary:

Using observed standards:

- pro: sensitive to relative calibration only
- pro: empirical matching of stellar physics
- con: requires observations of the reddened and unreddened stars
- con: spectral mismatch between the two stars

Using stellar models for standards:

- pro: better spectral matches
- pro: only need to observe the reddened star
- con: models are approximate at some level (can be missing lines/physics)
- con: dependent on the absolute calibration

Tlusty Stellar Atmosphere Models
--------------------------------

The
`Ostar <http://tlusty.oca.eu/Tlusty2002/tlusty-frames-OS02.html>`_ and
`Bstar <http://tlusty.oca.eu/Tlusty2002/tlusty-frames-BS06.html>`_
grids of Tlusty stellar atmosphere models
(`Hubeny & Lanz 1995 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995ApJ...439..875H/abstract>`_)
provide good standards, especially of hot, early type stars often used
in extinction studies as they are bright in the ultraviolet.

The `measure_extinction` package provides code to transform the tlusty
SEDs into the same format as the observed data.  In other words, it mocks
the spectroscopy and photometry allowing for models to look like they were
observed.  The specific code is `utils/make_obsdata_from_model.py`.
This code uses the 'merge_obsspec' functions to transform the model SEDs
to the observed spectral formats.
The `utils/make_all_tlusty_obsdata.py` runs on the `*.flux.gz` tlusty files.

STIS Mocking
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HST STIS observations are simulated by convolving the high spectral
resolution model spectra to the STIS resolution using STIS line-spread-fuctions (LSFs)
retrieved from
`STScI <https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/stis/performance/spectral-resolution>`_.
These line-spread functions are provided at specific wavelengths and are linearly
interpolated/extrapolated for other wavelengths (see `utils/mock_spectra_data.py`
for details.)
