Data Formats
############

The data for each stars are stored in a combination of an ASCII "DAT" file
and FITS "spectra" files.

DAT file
========

The ASCII file is the only required file.  This file gives the photometry
and links to the FITS files that contain the spectroscopy.  Many dat files
for stars used in literature dust extinction curves are provided in the 
`extstar_data repository <https://github.com/karllark/extstar_data>_`.

An example of
such a file (for a star from Valencic et al. 2004) that gives the Johnson photometry, 
location of IUE spectrum, and spectral types is below.  This includes the
photometry and associated uncertainties in Vega magnitudes.  Comments taking
an entire line are allowed if they start with a "#" character.

    # data file for observations of HD 38023
    V = 8.870 +/- 0.020
    B = 9.190 +/- 0.030
    U = 8.870 +/- 0.030
    J = 8.080 +/- 0.020
    H = 7.990 +/- 0.060
    K = 7.900 +/- 0.020
    IUE = IUE_Data/hd038023_iue.fits
    sptype = B4V
    uvsptype = B4IV

A more complicated example giving photometry and spectroscopy from different sources
is below (from a star from Gordon et al. 2021; Decleir et al. 2022 among other studies).
The Johnson photometry is provided mainly as colors in this example.  Photometry
from IRAC/IRS/MIPS is provided in mJy.  The different photometry units are converted to the
measure_extinction internal units when read into StarData.  In addition, there are comments
provided after data using the ";" character.

Spectra
=======

The spectra are stored in FITS files with standard columns and wavelength grids.
The standard columns are "WAVELENGTH", "FLUX", "SIGMA", and "NPTS".  These files
are created using the "merge_xxx_spec" functions provided in
:class:`~measure_extinction.merge_obsspec`.  These ensure that all the spectra
from a specific source (e.g., IUE) have the same wavelength grid, units, and standard
columns.

For some of the types of spectra (e.g., IUE, STIS, SpeX, NIRCam SS), 
there is commandline code in the `measure_extinction/utils` subdirectory to
create such files from the commandline.

When using a stellar model for the comparison, each type of spectra supported is 
simulated/mocked using code in the `measure_extinction/utils` subdirectory. 
See :ref:`model standards`.
